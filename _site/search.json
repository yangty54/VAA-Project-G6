    "text": "The global issue of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems and sustainable fishing practices. Through this project, we aim to leverage visual analytics techniques to analyze trade data and identify companies engaged in illegal fishing. By providing comprehensive insights and tools to detect patterns, anomalies, and business relationships, we can shed light to take effective measures against IUU fishing and protect marine species."
