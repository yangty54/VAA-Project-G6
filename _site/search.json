Appropriate handling of missing data is crucial to avoid introducing bias or inaccuracies in our analysis.\nIn the Nodes dataset, we encounter missing values in the categorical variables shpcountry and rcvcountry. We choose to use Random Sampling Imputation to handle these missing values. This method involves taking random observations from the dataset and using these to replace the missing data.

Multiple Imputation is a more sophisticated technique that creates plausible imputed values for the missing data based on the relationships observed in the data. This method provides a better estimate when the data is not missing at random, and it takes into account the uncertainty about the missing data by creating multiple datasets and analyzing each one separately.\nThe rationale for these choices is to maximize the utilization of available data, and not to lose valuable information by just removing all the rows containing NA, which would drastically reduce our dataset size."

It may be challenging to design visualizations that effectively convey the complex relationships within the knowledge graph and trade data.\nScalability: The sheer volume of data and the high-dimensional nature of the data (multiple attributes per node) might pose challenges to computation and visualization. It could be a challenge to develop methods that scale efficiently to handle this volume of data while maintaining the clarity of the visualizations.\nEvaluation of Link Suggestions: Evaluating the reliability of the suggested links for the knowledge graph requires the comparison of different scenarios, each with different sets of links added. This could become computationally demanding and may also lead to a combinatorial explosion of scenarios to evaluate.\nTemporal Pattern Identification: Tracking companies’ activities over time to detect whether they are resuming illegal fishing operations under different names is challenging, as it involves not only recognizing patterns but also making connections across different entities and timescales.\nInterpretation of Results: The results and visualizations need to be interpreted correctly to draw meaningful conclusions. There is always a risk of drawing false or misleading conclusions from the visualizations if not interpreted within the context of the data.\n\nDespite these challenges, we believe our methodological approach will allow us to gain valuable insights and make significant progress towards identifying companies possibly engaged in IUU fishing."

    "text": "Handling Missing Data\nMissing data is a common issue encountered in real-world datasets, and it is essential to handle it appropriately to ensure accurate analysis. In our datasets, both the Nodes and Edges datasets contain missing values that require attention.\nIn the Nodes dataset, we have identified missing values in the categorical variables “shpcountry” and “rcvcountry.” To address these missing values, we have chosen to use a method called Complete Case Analysis. This method involves removing any rows that contain missing values in the variables of interest. By doing so, we retain only the complete cases where all necessary information is available. This approach assumes that the missing data is missing completely at random (MCAR).\nMoving to the Edges dataset, we have observed missing data in multiple variables. To handle these missing values, we have employed another method called Listwise Deletion. This method involves removing any rows that contain missing values in any of the variables. By doing so, we retain only the complete cases in the dataset. However, it is important to note that this approach can result in a reduction of the dataset size if a significant number of rows contain missing values.\nAdditionally, considering the limitations of the Shiny app in handling large datasets, we have made the decision to trim down the data size to 50,000 observations. This reduction in the dataset size allows for smoother performance and faster rendering of visualizations within the Shiny app. However, it is important to note that this downsizing may result in a loss of some data granularity and potentially affect the representativeness of the analysis. It is advisable to consider the trade-off between computational constraints and the need for comprehensive data analysis when working with large datasets in interactive applications like Shiny."

These sections contain visual analytics of identifying temporal patterns for individual entities and between entities in the knowledge graph created from trade records.\n\nBy Fishtype\nThis tab shows the distribution of source nodes by fish type.\n\n\nStart by selecting fish type from the drop-down list. Users can choose as many fish types as they want.\nThen the bar chart will demonstrate the number of companies who engage in selected fish type trade. Comparison can be showed when multiple fish types are selected.\n\n\n\nShipment/month by fishtype\nThis tab shows the change in total shipments per month by fish type from 2028 to 2034.\n\n\nStart by selecting fish type from the list. Users can select as many as fish types as they want.\nThen the line chart will demonstrate the changes in total number of shipments from 2028 to 2034 for the selected fish type. When the users hover their mouse over the graph it will display the number of shipments of the fish type for specific year and month. Comparison can be showed when multiple fish types are selected.\n\n\n\nValue of Goods in Time\nThis tab shows the change in total value of goods from 2028 to 2034.\n\n\nStart by selecting the year range from Time Range slider. The default range is from 2028-01 to 2034-12.\nThen the line chart will demonstrate the changes in sum of value of goods from 2028-01 to 2034-12. When the users hover their mouse over the graph it will display the sum of value of goods for specific year and month. Sudden rise and fall in the value of goods can be detected from the trend of line.\n\n\n\nWeight vs Value of Goods\nThis tab explores the relationship between log value of weight and log value of goods from 2028 to 2034.\n\n\nStart by selecting the year from drop-down list.\nThen the graph will demonstrate the hexbin plot of weight vs value of goods in log scale."

The year range covers 2028 to 2034. Users can choose multiple years at the same time.\nThen the line chart will demonstrate the change in number of trade route of year selected. When users hover their mouse over the graph it will display the number of routes in specific month and year. Anomaly can be detected when there is a sudden rise or fall in the number of trade routes, indicating the companies not operating regular businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue in Time\nThis tab shows the change in total value of goods from 2028-01 to 2034-12.\n\n\nStart by selecting time range from Time Range Slider. The default range is from 2028-01 to 2034-12.\nThen the line chart will demonstrate the change in total value of goods within the year range selected. Anomaly can be detected when there is a surge in total value of goods which is above threshold at a point in time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight vs Value Ratio\nThis tab shows the linear relationship between the value of goods (log scale) and weight (log scale).\n\n\nStart by selecting the number of dots to be displayed on the graph.\nThen the line chart will demonstrate the linear regression between the above two variables. When users hover their mouse over the graph the value of weights and goods will be displayed, along with the results of anomaly detection. Outliers are considered as anomaly in this graph. Black dots represent the top anomaly and blue dots represent moderate anomaly which are suspected of illegal fishing."
